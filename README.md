I am currently in the fourth year of my bachelor degree program. It is a dual-degree program which has allowed me to study in Canada for 2.5 years and in Germany for 1.5 years, where I currently live. I am currently designing this app for my class at EBS Universitaet and this is one of my final assignments. The purpose of this app is aimed at sports.
